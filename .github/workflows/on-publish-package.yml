#
# The intention of this actions file is to allow
# both npm packages to be published and docker
# images to be built in the build job.
# After the build job has successfully published
# then the integration testing using the published
# modules and images can take place in the one
# actions file.
# The docker image built in the build job is used
# in the integration job as a service.
